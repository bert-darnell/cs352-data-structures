# CS352 Data Structures

This course had 4 primary porjects over the 7 week course.

1. Units 1 and 2: This assignment simulates a line of contestants in a competition, similar to a spelling bee, using a single ArrayList. Contestants move positions in the line based on a simulated coin flip, which determines if they answered a question correctly or incorrectly. The same thing is then implemented with LinkedList. The goal is to implement and compare the ArrayList and LinkedList.

2. Units 3 and 4: This program involves building a set of Java classes to find paths through a cave. By the end of the assignment, the program will read a 2D cave layout from a file, search for a path to a "mirror pool", and print the path. The focus is on constructing the data structure, including data storage in a 2D structure, searching for a simple path, and reading data from a file, without using recursion or backtracking.

3. Units 5 and 6: This assignment reads weather data from a file then sort it by two different methods. One is the provided sort() method, and the other one is my own implementation of a mergeSort algorithm. I will compare the execution time of a LinkedList and TreeMap.

4. Unit 7: This program reads a text file and count the number of times each word occurs. The project focuses on comparing the HashMap and TreeMap execution times.
